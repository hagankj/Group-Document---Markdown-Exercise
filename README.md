### Company Background

Equifax NeuroDecision Technology is a neural network that computes credit scores (a.k.a. credit ratings)
for individuals, those all-important numbers that determine your fate when you apply for a loan. In the
past, neural network models have been used for credit scoring much less than might be expected, given
their ability to identify the non-linear relationships in typical inputs to scoring models. This is because the
basis on which traditional neural networks generate their results is not readily explainable, a situation that
regulators, such as the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the European General Data
Protection Regulation, find unacceptable. Equifaxâ€™s technology offers the power of a well trained neural
net, but one with the ability to explain its decision making.
