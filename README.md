Case Study Proposal

Equifax NeuroDecision Technology
What Is It
Equifax NeuroDecision Technology is a neural network that computes credit scores (a.k.a. credit ratings)
for individuals, those all-important numbers that determine your fate when you apply for a loan. In the
past, neural network models have been used for credit scoring much less than might be expected, given
their ability to identify the non-linear relationships in typical inputs to scoring models. This is because the
basis on which traditional neural networks generate their results is not readily explainable, a situation that
regulators, such as the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the European General Data
Protection Regulation, find unacceptable. Equifax’s technology offers the power of a well trained neural
net, but one with the ability to explain its decision making.
Why This Matters
Equifax is one of the “big three” credit rating agencies, each of which provide prospective lenders with a
numerical score that indicates the credit worthiness of just about any prospective U.S. borrower. These
numbers play an important role in deciding the rate at which the loan would be extended and even
whether credit would be extended at all. Thus, the calculation of these scores affects many millions of
people.
Accurate calculation of such scores is therefore of primary importance. Yet, in the past, such scores were
computed via logistic regression, a technique that attempts to partition the data using linear functions.
However, nonlinear relationships are embedded in the data that might predict the likelihood of defaulting
on, say, credit card debt (Such an example might be the relationship between income and default
probability: once income gets above a certain level, people are less likely to have to choose between
credit card payments and feeding their children.). Neural nets certainly solve this problem, but they do so
by “learning” an obscure and nonlinear weighting scheme. NeuroDecision technology attempts to
identify the reasons why its neural net’s calculations turn out the way they do.
Also, machine learning cannot now be used in many other applications that seem to be begging for it. For
example, IBM’s Watson failed miserably when it was marketed to the oncology departments of hospitals,
as doctors and patients lost faith in it, partly because of Watson’s inability to explain its
recommendations. “Explainable AI” may well provide at least a partial answer, so it is currently very hot.
Why This May Be Interesting
● Many people have some kind of debt and many more will likely take on debt in the near future
(cars, houses, etc.). One can most likely relate to credit rating technology, and especially to rating
technology that isn’t opaque.
● Machine learning using neural networks is undoubtedly of interest, regardless of application.
● Credit related applications, in particular, are of great interest to the financial community, so
students who can make themselves useful to such projects should be able to find highly paid
employment. In addition to credit bureaus and lenders (including many fintech start-ups), large
consultancies, such as the Boston Consulting Group, and accounting firms, such as KPMG,
actively recruit machine learning specialists.
